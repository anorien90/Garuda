feat: Replace instance deletion with stop/halt to preserve quota

Changed Exoscale Ollama adapters to stop (halt) instances instead of 
deleting them when idle or shutting down. This preserves instances to 
avoid quota limitations and enables faster restarts.

Changes:
- Renamed destroy_instance() to stop_instance() in both adapters
- Updated ensure_instance() to handle halted state
- Modified idle monitor and shutdown to stop instead of delete
- Updated CLI stop command to preserve instances
- Updated all tests and documentation

Benefits:
- Quota preservation (no instance creation limits hit)
- Faster restarts (30-60s vs 1-2 minutes)  
- Same cost savings (stopped instances don't incur charges)
- Backward compatible behavior
