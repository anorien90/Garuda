feat(chat): Add step progress tracking and final state indication

Ensures Chat UI always returns a result with clear step tracking,
even after multiple web crawl cycles.

## Changes

### Backend (search.py)
- Added `current_step` field to track actively running phase
- Added `final_step` field to indicate conclusive outcome state
- Implemented step tracking across all 4 phases:
  * Phase 1: Initial RAG lookup
  * Phase 2: Retry with paraphrasing
  * Phase 3: Web crawling cycles (1-10 configurable)
  * Phase 4: Final local lookup after crawling
- Enhanced fallback handling with proper error states
- Added safety net for unknown states

### Frontend (render-chat.js)  
- Added color-coded final step badge:
  * Green (✅): Successful completion
  * Amber (⚡): Insufficient but best effort
  * Red (⚠️): Error state or fallback
- Formatted final step display for human readability
- Added support for all possible step states

### Documentation (README.md)
- Documented all final step values
- Explained color-coded badge system
- Added examples for each state
- Clarified when each state occurs

### Tests (test_chat_final_step_tracking.py)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 16 tests
- Tests for all final step scenarios
- Tests for step progression logic
- Tests for multi-cycle behavior
- All tests passing (16/16)

## Final Step States

**Success:**
- phase1_local_lookup
- phase2_local_lookup_after_retry
- phase4_local_lookup_after_cycle_N
- phase4_local_lookup_success

**Warning:**
- phase4_local_lookup_insufficient_after_all_cycles

**Error:**
- error_no_urls_found_after_all_cycles
- error_fallback_answer_generated
- unknown_state

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible:
- New fields are additive only
- Existing fields unchanged
- No breaking changes

## Testing

- Unit tests: 16/16 passed
- Python syntax: Valid
- JavaScript syntax: Valid
- CodeQL security: 0 vulnerabilities
- PEP8: Follows existing style

## Issue

Resolves: Chat UI should always return a result with step 
indication even after multiple web crawl cycles.
